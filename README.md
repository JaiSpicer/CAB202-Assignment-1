First C Programming assignment. Had to make a game like Pong except had to add more features

##Features Working:
0. Basic Functions - Working
1. Left AI - Working
2. Curved Paddle - Working
3. Point Blocks - Working
4. Add Paddle Length - Working
5. Minus Paddle Length - Working
6. Ball Splitter - Not working
7. Wind Block - Working
8. Ball Muncher - Working (first appear at score count of 25 and so on)

##Known Bugs:
1. Sometimes the ball will go through the very bottom of the left paddle 
2. Sometimes the ball with hit an invisible right paddle bellow the real one
3. When the wind block is activated if its increasing the speed really close to the paddle it might go through the paddle as its using doublex and doubley veriables
